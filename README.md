XAdES implementation for the Apache's apache.xml.sec Project


This is just a short summary/intro:

Our Project is rather old, from 2007;
Feel free to modify it and make it better;
there are two main folders:
+-> library: it's containing just the XAdES library we developed;
--> proj: this contains the actual Eclipse project(i'll get it up2date as soon as catch some time);
